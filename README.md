# Protocols for Generating all figures

<p>This repository contains the workflow used to generate figures for the publication. For each figure, there is a subfolder with scripts and input files needed to generate each figure.</p>

## System Requirements / Environment Notes

<p>This work was performed using the compute resources from the Academic Leiden Interdisciplinary Cluster Environment (ALICE) provided by Leiden University where Python, Bash, and GPU-enabled tools were already available. The exact versions used may vary, and the protocol does not depend on any single specific setup.</p>

**Users should ensure:**

- Bash available in their shell
- Python 3.x available in the PATH
- Ability to install or load <strong>Amber and AmberTools</strong>
- Standard Unix command-line tools (`awk`, `sed`, `grep`)
- A Linux-based environment (HPC cluster)

<p><em>Note:</em> Since systems vary, users should adapt the environment to their own setup. Any reasonably recent Python/Bash version should work.</p>
